<p>The Department of French and Francophone Studies opened a DELF Testing Center in Spring 23 to provide French learners the opportunity to certify their language proficiency level.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-delf">What is DELF?</h2>

<p>DELF stands for Diploma in French Language Studies (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Diplôme d’études en langue française</code>). This diploma is awarded by the French Ministry of Education to non-French candidates as a certification of their French language proficiency. It is an internationally recognized certification that assesses communication skills in French as a foreign language.</p>

<h2 id="delf-levels">DELF Levels</h2>

<p>As a potential DELF candidate, you can choose from four different levels of proficiency, aligned with the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFRL):</p>

<ul>
  <li>DELF A1: Basic user 1</li>
  <li>DELF A2: Basic user 2</li>
  <li>DELF B1: Independent user 1</li>
  <li>DELF B2: Independent user 2</li>
</ul>
