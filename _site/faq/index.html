<h3 id="can-i-register-for-different-delf-levels-at-once">Can I register for different DELF levels at once?</h3>
<p>Yes, you certainly can. But it is always good to talk with your French instructor as s/he will be able to guide you the best.</p>

<h3 id="can-i-register-for-the-mock-delf-but-not-yet-for-the-real-delf-exam">Can I register for the mock DELF, but not yet for the real DELF exam?</h3>
<p>Yes, and we encourage you to do so. However, seats are limited and the registration is organized on a first come, first served basis.</p>

<h3 id="where-do-i-pay-to-secure-my-delf-registration">Where do I pay to secure my DELF registration?</h3>
<p>You can register on this website. We have limited resources and seats are therefore limited, but we will do our best to accommodate the demand.</p>

<p>No, Brown has created an exchange program with Parisian universities and to be able to participate in this program, you need to validate FREN 0600 course with at least a grade of B. A DELF exam is not required.</p>
