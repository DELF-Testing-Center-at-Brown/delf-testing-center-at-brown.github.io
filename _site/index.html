<p>The Department of French and Francophone Studies opened a DELF Testing Center in Spring 23 to provide French learners the opportunity to certify their language proficiency level.</p>

<p>DELF is a French acronym that means Diploma in French language studies (“Diplôme d’études en langue française” in French) and this diploma is awarded by the French Ministry of Education to demonstrate the proficiency across the 4 communication skills of non-French candidates (French learners). More precisely, it is a global assessment that validates communication skills in French as a foreign language, and this certification is internationally recognized.</p>

<p>As a French learner, and potential DELF candidate, 4 DELF options are possible as each option corresponds to a different level of proficiency according to the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages. These 4 options are exemplified below for your convenience:</p>

<ul>
  <li>DELF B2 = Independent user 2</li>
  <li>DELF B1 = Independent user 1</li>
  <li>DELF A2 = Basic user 2</li>
  <li>DELF A1 = Basic user 1</li>
</ul>

<p>To help you choose your DELF proficiency test registration level (A1, A2, B1, or B2), you may contact your current French instructor, consult the DELF Resources below, and/or contact the director of the DELF testing center at Brown (Stéphanie Gaillard at <a href="mailto:stephanie_gaillard@brown.edu">stephanie_gaillard@brown.edu</a>).</p>

<p>Depending on your project(s) with the French language (i.e., internship, work, immigration), the DELF might be a necessary certification to work professionally or to undertake studies in a French/Francophone university or Grande École. The DELF is also required for immigration purposes in various French-speaking countries such as Canada, France, or Belgium.</p>
