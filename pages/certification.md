# DELF – French Certification at Brown

The Department of French and Francophone Studies opened a DELF Testing Center in Spring 23 to provide French learners the opportunity to certify their language proficiency level.

## What is DELF?

DELF stands for Diploma in French Language Studies (`Diplôme d’études en langue française`). This diploma is awarded by the French Ministry of Education to non-French candidates as a certification of their French language proficiency. It is an internationally recognized certification that assesses communication skills in French as a foreign language.

## DELF Levels

As a potential DELF candidate, you can choose from four different levels of proficiency, aligned with the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFRL):

- DELF A1: Basic user 1
- DELF A2: Basic user 2
- DELF B1: Independent user 1
- DELF B2: Independent user 2

## Choosing the Right Level

To select the appropriate DELF test level (A1, A2, B1, or B2), you can consult with your current French instructor, refer to the DELF Resources section, or contact Stéphanie Gaillard, the director of the DELF testing center at Brown (stephanie_gaillard@brown.edu).

## Importance of DELF

The DELF certification can be a necessary credential for professional work or studies in a French/Francophone university. It is also required for immigration purposes in various French-speaking countries.
