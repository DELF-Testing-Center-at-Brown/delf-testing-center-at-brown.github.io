# DELF - Frequently Asked Questions

### Can I register for different DELF levels at once?
Yes, you certainly can. But it is always good to talk with your French instructor as s/he will be able to guide you the best. 

### Can I register for the mock DELF, but not yet for the real DELF exam? 
Yes, and we encourage you to do so. However, seats are limited and the registration is organized on a first come, first served basis.

### Where do I pay to secure my DELF registration?
You can register on this website. We have limited resources and seats are therefore limited, but we will do our best to accommodate the demand.

### I am a student on financial aid. Can I get some financial support?
Yes, please visit: [Brown University Financial Aid](https://ufunds.brown.edu/)

### Am I required to take a DELF exam to participate in the Brown in France program?
No, Brown has created an exchange program with Parisian universities and to be able to participate in this program, you need to validate FREN 0600 course with at least a grade of B. A DELF exam is not required.

### How can I prepare for the DELF exam?
Please consult the [DELF Resources](/delf-resources/) tab.
